# TextGraphs-14: COLING 2020

## Multi-Hop Inference for Explanation Regeneration
The workshops in the TextGraphs series have published and promoted the synergy between the field of Graph Theory and Natural Language Processing. Besides traditional NLP applications like word sense disambiguation and semantic role labeling, and information extraction graph-based solutions nowadays also target new web-scale applications like information propagation in social networks, rumor proliferation, e-reputation, language dynamics learning, and future events prediction, to name a few.  Previous editions of the series can be found [here](http://textgraphs.org/).

We are attempting the shared task on **Multi-Hop Inference for Explanation Regeneration** at the [TextGraphs-14 workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/textgraphs2020), part of Coling 2020.

### Result:
Results of different models on the test, train and dev dataset can be found here.
The results have been in terms of the **MAP** scores.
